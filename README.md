You need Microsoft Visual C++ 64-bit compiler.
Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition is assumed in the setenv.cmd file, but you
should be able to use other versions of Visual Studio too.

Build is done from command-line.
Start cmd.exe, then switch to source directory, then:

    setenv.cmd
    nmake
