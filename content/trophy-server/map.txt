# trophy-server map
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Format: tournament-id,tournament-id2,content-root-folder-path
# Where:
#   content-root-folder-path is relative to "content\trophy-server"
#   tournament-id2 is which other tournament's trophy scenes you want to use for your tournament
#
# IMPORTANT: It is best to remap cups to cups and leagues to leagues,
# otherwise the game gets a bit confused. For example, English Premier League (17)
# can be remapped to Swiss League (117), and then the trophy ceremony will
# be correctly displayed after the match where you win the league (if you do :-))
#
# (If you remap a league to a cup or vice versa, it will still work. For example,
# you could remap EPL (17) to AFC Champions League (16). But the commentary during
# trophy presentation may sound a bit strange, because the game will confuse
# a league match with a cup match. Not a huge deal, but just be aware.)
#
# For reference, use doc/tournaments.txt provided with sider:
# It has tournament ids for all tournaments in the game.
