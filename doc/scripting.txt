Sider 5 Lua Module Programmers Guide
====================================
For sider.dll version: 5.0.2
September 6, 2018



1. Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main idea here is to provide a safe and flexible way to
extend Sider functionality. It allow modders to alter many
aspects of game logic, and load all sorts of extra content
and in future versions, gameplay tweaks will be possible too.

Instead of offering a C interface, where the programmers would need
to write a DLL, i'm a taking a different approach here and trying to
design a system, where extension modules are written in Lua. A module
would typically initialize itself by registering for certain events,
and then Sider will call the module functions, when those events
occur later in the game.

Lua is by now a well-established language of choice for scripting
support in games, used all over the gaming industry. Most famous
example is probably WarCraft, but many modern games use it, including
Pro Evolution Soccer itself.

To boost the performance, Sider uses a just-in-time compiler for Lua
called LuaJIT, written by Mike Pall. LuaJIT is a truly brilliant piece
of software. It is 100% compatible with Lua 5.1, and it is super fast,
often approaching and sometimes exceeding the speed of C code.
( More information here: https://luajit.org )

After reading this guide, the next step is to study the example (and
non-example) modules, which are provided with this release of Sider.
Find them in the "modules" directory.



2. Module structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are familiar with Lua and how modules are typically organized
then this will make full sense to you. If are you new to Lua, i would
strongly recommend reading "Programming in Lua" by Roberto Ierusalimschy.
2nd edition covers Lua 5.1, which is the version of the language used
by Sider. However, any other edition of the book will be just as helpful.

In any case, the module organization is pretty simple:

a) Your need to create a new table
b) Provide an "init" function in that table, where you need to
do any initialization logic for the module and register for the events
your module is interested in.
c) Return that table as the last statement

Example module:

-----------------------------
local m = {}

function m.init(ctx)
    log("Hello, world!")
end

return m
-----------------------------


As you have already guessed, this module doesn't really do much. But it
is a valid module, and can be loaded by Sider. For that you need to save
it as <something>.lua file in the "modules" folder, inside sider. Let's
assume that you named it: test.lua. Then, you must also enable it in
sider.ini, like this:

lua.module = "test.lua"

**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
VERY IMPORTANT: File encoding must be UTF-8. This is vital, if you are
using non-latin characters in the strings in the module code - for example,
in paths. If you only have latin-1 chars, then ANSI is ok too.
**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************

If you now run the game, your module will get loaded by Sider, and then
the "init" function will be called, so you should see a "Hello, world!"
message in sider.log.

If you made a mistake and your module has a syntax error, for example,
or some other problem, then you should see an error message in sider.log,
explaining where (on which line of the script) the problem occurred.

Let's now see how you can make a more useful module. First step for that
is to understand the context object (ctx).



3. Context object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Context object is what Sider "knows" about the current state
of the game. As more scripts/modules are created by the community
the context object will probably also change, and include more and more
information about the game.

As of 5.0.2 release, the context object has the following:

ctx.home_team  - id of the home team of the current match, after
                 it is selected in the exhibition match, or the next
                 match is determined in the league mode.

ctx.away_team  - id of the away team of the current match, after
                 it is selected in the exhibition match, or the next
                 match is determined in the league mode.

ctx.tournament_id  -  numeric id of the current tournament. See
                      doc/tournament.txt file for the list
                      of ids for all of the game's tournaments.

ctx.match_id   - some sort of number, which seems to indicate where
                 in the season you currently are. However, the exact
                 meaning of this id is unclear. Maybe you can figure
                 it out and tell me ;-)

ctx.match_leg  - set to 1 or 2, if this is 1st leg or 2nd leg of
                 a two-legged knock-out match.

ctx.match_info - meaning of this field varies, depending on the type
                 of tournament:
                     league: number of league matches already played
                     cup/play-off:
                         46 - first round of play-off,
                         47 - second round of play-off,
                         51 - quaterfinal,
                         52 - semifinal,
                         53 - final
                 You can use this together with ctx.tournament_id to
                 identify a final match of a particular tournament.

ctx.stadium    - numeric id of the stadium that will be used (or was
                 last used, if the stadium for the next match hasn't
                 been chosen yet by the game logic)

ctx.stadium_choice - This field is set when the game is in one of the
                     exhibition modes, and the stadium is allowed to
                     be selected via the menu. Once the actual final
                     selection of the stadium is made (right after the
                     "set_stadium" event fires), the "stadium_choice"
                     field get removed from the context.
                     Special values:
                          253 - home stadium
                          254 - random stadium
                          255 - not chosen yet

ctx.timeofday  - The values are: 0 - Day, 1 - Night. Same as with
                 stadium, it represents the time of day of the coming
                 match, or the last one, if the stadium isn't set yet
                 for the next match.

ctx.season     - The values are: 0 - Summer, 1 - Winter.

ctx.weather    - The values are: 0 - Fine, 1 - Rainy, 2 - Snowy

ctx.weather_effects - The known values are:
                        2 - enforce weather effects (rain/snow falling)

ctx.match_time - Duration of the match in minutes.


The context object also contains a register function, which has the
following signature:

ctx.register(event_name, handler_function)

The event_name parameter is a string, which identifies a particular
event. The handler_function should be a function in your Lua module,
which will be called when the corresponding event happens. Parameters
vary depending on the event - see the next section for details on all
supported events and their handler signatures

The idea of the context object is that in your handler functions, your
code will make decisions on what to do, using the information in the
context.



4. Supported events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


- Event name: "livecpk_make_key"
Handler function: f(ctx, filename)
Return value is expected to be a string or nil.

This event occurs when the game needs to find out some information
about the file, specified by relative filename. Maybe the game needs
to create a buffer, or it needs to determine the filesize, or something
else. Your handler function is expected to return a string key that
will be used for caching of "livecpk_get_filepath". You can just
return filename as the key, without any changes, or return nil -
which will result in the same outcome. But sometimes, you need to make
a different key, because the context has some additional information
that is important.

IMPORTANT: This event can fire a lot of times for a given filename,
so try to avoid doing expensive computations in the handler function
or logging anything, because it may affect your frame rate.


- Event name: "livecpk_get_filepath"
Handler function: f(ctx, filename, key)
Return value is expected to be a string or nil.

This event is related to "livecpk_make_key".
It works like this: after the key is returned by livecpk_make_key
handler, sider needs to know which actual file (absolute path) needs
to be loaded for this key. So your handler function is expected to
return a full absolute filename. Sider will cache this absolute filename
using the key returned by livecpk_make_key, and the next time this file
is needed, the livecpk_get_filepath event will NOT fire. (This is
again done for performance reasons so that we don't unnecessarily seek
the disk).


- Event name: "livecpk_rewrite"
Handler function: f(ctx, filename)
Return value is expected to be a string or nil.

Allows the filename to be rewritten to another. This is a very
powerful, but also quite dangerous function, if you are not careful.
If you rewrite the filename to something that does not exist in
LiveCPK roots or in download/data CPKs, and none of your modules
provide the content, then the game will be unable to load the file,
which can lead to different behaviours, depending on type of file being
loaded. If it's a DDS texture, then usually nothing bad happens -
you just get a white texture. But if it is a model file - you will
get an endless loop, where loading indicator will keep spinning
forever, or the game can just crash. So, be careful,
and don't rewrite blindly ;-)

See "kitrewrite.lua" module for an example of rewrite usage: it is
loading a 2nd player kit instead of a 1st goalkeeper kit, so your
goalkeepers end up wearing 2nd kit of outfield players.



5. Logging
~~~~~~~~~~

Sider provides a function called "log". This can be used to print
out any information you want into the sider.log file.
You can use string.format to format your message in a way similar
to what you would do with C printf:

log(string.format("My value is: %0.5f", math.pi))

In sider.log it will appear with a module name prefix, like as:

[<modulename>.lua] My value is: 3.14159



6. Module environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each module runs in its own environment. For detailed explanation
on what an environment is - read about Lua environments in the Lua
manual online, or in Programming in Lua book. What is important
here is that a module has access to a limited set of globals:

Standard Lua:
    assert, ipairs, pairs, tostring, tonumber, table,
    string, math, unpack, type, error, io, os, _VERSION, _G
Sider:
    log, memory, _FILE

You can also enable "ffi" and "bit" modules, which are LuaJIT
extensions. By default, they are disabled. To enable, modify your
sider.ini like this:

luajit.ext.enabled = 1

By the way, your module can "investigate" and find out what exactly
is available for it to use - this is not hard, and is left as an
exercise for the reader ;-) Or... you can cheat, and look at env.lua
module.



7. Memory library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "memory" library provides a set of low-level functions that
may prove useful if you're doing some advanced modding.

For example, you need some game state info that is not available in
sider's context object and isn't communicated through events either.
Or you want to modify some bytes in memory, because you feel really
adventurous.


**********************************************************************
**********************************************************************
IMPORTANT WARNING: PLEASE USE THIS LIBRARY WITH CARE AND CAUTION,
AND IF AND ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. REALLY.

THESE ARE POWERFUL TOOLS, BUT THERE ARE ALSO DANGEROUS, BECAUSE
WRITING INTO A WRONG PLACE IN MEMORY CAN HAVE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES.
ALWAYS TRY TO HAVE A BACKUP COPY OF YOUR EDIT DATA AND SAVEGAME FILES.
**********************************************************************
**********************************************************************


memory.read(addr, n)

This function reads (n) bytes at memory address (addr).
Return value: string of n bytes at given memory address


memory.write(addr, str)

This function writes the string of bytes (str) at the address (addr).
Return value: nil


memory.search(str, start_addr, end_addr)

This function searches for the string of bytes (str), in the range
of memory addresses between start_addr and end_addr.
Return value: address, at which the string of bytes was found
              or nil, if the string was not found.


memory.pack(format, number)

This function converts a Lua number into one of the supported binary
formats (little endian). The "format" parameter is a string that should
have one of the following values:
"f"   : 32-bit float,
"d"   : 64-bit double-precision float,
"i64" : 64-bit signed integer,
"u64" : 64-bit unsigned integer,
"i32" : 32-bit signed integer,
"u32" : 32-bit unsigned integer,
"i16" : 16-bit signed integer,
"u16" : 16-bit unsigned integer
Return value: string of bytes, representing the number in the format
specified by the "format" parameter


memory.unpack(format, str)

This function converts a string of bytes (str) into a Lua number, using
the format parameter to interpret the binary spec. The same values are
supported for "format" param as in memory.pack function.
Return value: a Lua number, converted from binary representation

These last two functions (memory.pack/memory.unpack) are useful, when
used together with memory.read and memory.write, when you need to read
and modify values in RAM and you know what binary formats are used for
those values. See modules/memtest.lua - as the example module that
demonstrates the usage.


memory.hex(value)

Utility function to output value in hexadecimal format.
Depending on the type of value, the output differs slightly:

    local s = 'Football'
    log(memory.hex(s))  --> prints "466f6f7462616c6c" in the log

    local n = 12345
    log(memory.hex(n))  --> prints "0x3039" in the log


memory.get_process_info()

This function queries the game process (PES2019.exe) for information
about where it is loaded in memory.
Return value: a table containing at least two keys:
    "base" - base address of the main process in memory
    "sections" - a table of tables, with each member table containing
                 at least these keys:
         "name"   - name of the section
         "start"  - starting address in memory
         "finish" - first address beyond this section


memory.search_process(s)

This function searches for a string s in memory, but unlike memory.search
function, it does not take start and finish addresses. Instead, it searches
the game process sections, one at a time, until it finds the string, or
until all sections are examined.
Returns 2 values:
    1) address of string s in memory, if found, or nil - otherwise
    2) table with section info, in which the string was found.
